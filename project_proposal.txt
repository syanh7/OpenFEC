## Project Proposal

### Overview

This project will allow for visualization of FEC data of candidates 
and committees funding their campaigns. The goal of this is to 
allow users to easily interact with FEC data from the OpenFEC api, 
to see overall patterns in campaign contributions.

committees -candidates -zip -state -party,
cash_on_hand -candidates -cash -debt
